# CS665Assign5
#### With this assignment, starting with Part1 the use of the Observer (Behavioral) pattern gives some benefits in the form of being able to notify users of either promotional or product innovation.  This allows for registering, removal and notification to the various users through classes and interfaces such as SimpleSubject (which, in this case, I have built out two, one each for Product and Promotion) So in this part, where we want to get an output of various types of notices, of which there are only 2 we have been able to use Observer in order to enhance the basic no frills notification offered, which allows for potential expansion of other notices. 
#### For Part2, this is a composite design pattern the justification for using this is design pattern is due to the fact a heirarchical structure exists with the monthly, quarterly and 1/2 yearly statements. This assists to keep objects and composition of objects more uniform. Composite design pattern is also useful for recursion and flexiblity which we have achieved here.
